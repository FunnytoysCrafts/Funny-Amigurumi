          Welcome to my store, where live knitted dolls.
          Every toy and doll is hand made and safe for children.
          Dolls are ready to be good friends to your children and an excellent gift for any holiday.
        </p>
        <p>
          All toys can be made in any color and size according to your request.
          If the toys are not currently in the store - make an order and within 5 days a new one
          will be ready.
        </p>
        <p>
          When buying one toy, you will receive a 15% discount on the next purchase (with a lower
          price).
